THEME: YOLO  One Life Only
shuang81

background: each time you "die" your descendent carries on your quest.  Items you collect during your life are passed on to future generations.  

NOTE: sometimes buggy if you spam inputs after death.  

Assets:  Everything was made by me.  However the only assets which are new are the player and attack animations.
Code: Everything was written in the 12 hour period.  I used pyganim (pyganim.py), a library I found on pygame.com

controls: 
	arrows: 	movement
	z: 			attack
